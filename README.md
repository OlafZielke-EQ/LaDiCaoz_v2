# LaDiCaoz_v2
LaDiCaoz, which stands for Laterial Displacement Calculator, is a MATLAB-based app that allows to visualize high-res. DEM data (as acquired for example from opentopography.org) and to measure the offset of displaced geomorphic landforms. Contrary to the name's suggestion, it is able to measure horizontal AND vertical displacements.
In time, I'm going to add tutorial videos here that help to use the tool.
